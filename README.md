# InferenceHelper

# About
- This is a helper class for deep learning frameworks especially for inference
- Supported frameworks:
	- TensorFlow Lite
	- TensorFlow Lite with delegate (GPU, XNNPACK, EdgeTPU)
	- TensorRT
	- OpenCV(dnn)
	- ncnn
	- MNN
- This class provides an interface to use various deep learnig frameworks, so that you can use the same code
